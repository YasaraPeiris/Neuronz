trainModel(layers, dataSize) : layers - a row vector of the number of neurons in each hidden layer. dataSize - the number of images to be considered in training and testing. testingSize = dataSize * (1 - training ratio). Eg: trainModel([1000, 100], 10000) will train a model with 2 hidden layers. First hidden layer 1000 neurons and second hidden layer 100 neurons. The input layer 784 neurons (28 * 28 images) and output layer 10 neurons (0 - 9 clusters).  The actual training size will be the whole of data, since training and predicting can be done simultaneously using STDP.
